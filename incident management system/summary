Incident management system

Build a system which has following capabilities
Onboard users and team. Users can have different roles like developer, lead, manager.
Create an incident and assign it to the respective team based on configuration.
It should have capabilities to notify users using email,call,sms,slack
It should have capabilities to escalate the incident. Eg. escalate to level 2, escalate to level 3. This can be based on rules, such as notify level 1 twice and if it does not get responded escalate to level 2.
Build schedules for on call.
Write models and what all the apis the system will have. This was the question
